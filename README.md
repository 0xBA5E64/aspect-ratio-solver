# 🖽📏 Dovah's Resolution to Aspect-ratio Solver

This is a simple web-tool which aids in determining the common aspect ratio of an image (eg; `16:9`, `4:3`, etc), as opposed to a decimal one (`1.777` repeating for 16:9, or `1.333` repeating for 4:3)

Simply enter your image's width and height in pixels and read the graph to determine the most likely aspect ratio.

Although I've put effort into making sure this is still a somewhat "advanced" tool, capable of filtering out bad data, I still feel the need to stress that this is tool is *not* perfect, and could do with a vast amount of polish, which I'll hopefully one day be able to bring.
